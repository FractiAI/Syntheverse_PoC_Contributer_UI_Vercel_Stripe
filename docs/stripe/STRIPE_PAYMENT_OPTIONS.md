# 💳 Stripe Payment Options Explained

## What You Currently Have: Pricing Table ✅

Your app uses a **Stripe Pricing Table** - this is an embedded component that shows pricing options on your `/subscribe` page. This is what you already set up with:

- Pricing Table ID: `prctbl_1Sgbe509dcGq3dt0CgPQ4MFg`
- It's embedded in your app at: `/app/subscribe/page.tsx`
- Users can select plans and subscribe directly on your site

---

## What is a Payment Link?

A **Payment Link** is a simple URL you can share with customers. It's a standalone checkout page that doesn't require embedding in your website.

**Use cases:**

- Share via email, social media, or messaging
- Quick one-time payments or subscriptions
- Don't need a full pricing page on your site
- Want a simple URL to share

**Example:** `https://buy.stripe.com/test/xxxxx`

## Do You Need a Payment Link?

### ✅ You DON'T need a Payment Link if:

- You want customers to subscribe on your website (you already have this!)
- You're using the pricing table you already set up
- You want a more integrated experience

### ✅ You DO need a Payment Link if:

- You want to share a simple URL for quick payments
- You want to accept payments without users visiting your site
- You're sending email campaigns with payment links
- You want a backup payment method

## Recommendation

**For your Syntheverse PoC Contributor UI:**

Since you already have:

- ✅ A pricing table set up
- ✅ A `/subscribe` page with the pricing table
- ✅ Webhook handling for subscriptions
- ✅ User authentication and subscription management

**You probably DON'T need a Payment Link** unless you want to:

- Share quick payment options via email
- Have a backup payment method
- Accept one-time payments in addition to subscriptions

**Your current setup is better** because:

- Users stay on your site
- Better user experience
- Full control over the checkout flow
- Better integration with your app

---

## If You Want Both (Optional)

You can have both! They serve different purposes:

1. **Pricing Table** - For your main `/subscribe` page (already set up ✅)
2. **Payment Link** - For sharing via email, social media, or quick payments

Just create the Payment Link as described above, and you'll have both options available.
