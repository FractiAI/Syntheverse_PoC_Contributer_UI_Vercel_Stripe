## What Your Code Does with Each Event

### Your webhook handler (`app/webhook/stripe/route.ts`) handles:

**`customer.subscription.created` & `customer.subscription.updated`:**

```typescript
// Updates user's plan in database
await db
  .update(usersTable)
  .set({ plan: event.data.object.id })
  .where(eq(usersTable.stripe_id, (event.data.object as any).customer));
```

**`customer.subscription.deleted`:**

```typescript
// Logs subscription cancellation
console.log('Subscription deleted:', event.data.object.id);
```

**Other events:**

- `checkout.session.completed` - Useful for tracking completions
- `invoice.payment_succeeded` - Track successful recurring payments
- `invoice.payment_failed` - Handle failed payments (you may want to add logic for this)

---

## Optional Events (You Can Add Later)

These are not required but might be useful:

- `payment_intent.succeeded` - Track successful one-time payments
- `payment_intent.payment_failed` - Track failed payments
- `customer.created` - Track when new customers are created
- `customer.updated` - Track customer updates

**For now, stick with the 6 required events listed above.**
