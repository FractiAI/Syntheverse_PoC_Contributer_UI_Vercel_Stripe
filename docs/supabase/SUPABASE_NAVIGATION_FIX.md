# Supabase OAuth Providers Location

## EXACT Steps to Find Google:

### Step 1: Access Supabase

- URL: https://app.supabase.io/
- Sign in to your account
- Select your 'Syntheverse' project

### Step 2: Navigate to Authentication

- Left sidebar → Click 'Authentication'
- Should see tabs at the top: 'Users', 'Policies', 'Providers', etc.

### Step 3: Click 'Providers' Tab

- If you don't see 'Providers' tab, you might be on old dashboard
- Try refreshing the page (Ctrl+F5)

### Step 4: Find Google Provider

- Scroll down the providers list
- Look for 'Google' (with Google logo)
- NOT 'Auth0' (that's a different service)

### Alternative Navigation:

1. In URL bar, go to:
   https://app.supabase.io/project/YOUR_PROJECT/auth/providers
2. Replace YOUR_PROJECT with your actual project name

## What You Should See:

- List of providers: Apple, Azure, Bitbucket, Discord, Facebook, GitHub, **Google**, etc.
- Each has an expand arrow (>) to configure

## If Still Missing:

- Check your Supabase plan (OAuth is available on free tier)
- Try a different browser
- Clear browser cache
- Contact Supabase support

## Screenshot Request:

Can you tell me what tabs you see under 'Authentication'?
Example: 'Users | Policies | Providers | Logs'
