```
https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks
```

```
https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
```

Just paste this URL in your browser and you'll go straight to webhooks!

---

### Option B: Navigate from Dashboard

1. **Go to Stripe Dashboard**

   - Visit: https://dashboard.stripe.com/
   - Make sure you're in **Test mode** (toggle switch in top right should say "Test mode")

2. **Find "Developers" in the Left Sidebar**

   - Look at the left sidebar menu
   - You should see these options:
     - Home
     - Payments
     - Customers
     - Products
     - **Developers** ← This is what you're looking for!
     - Reports
     - Settings
     - etc.

3. **Click "Developers"**

   - Click on **"Developers"** in the left sidebar
   - A submenu will appear or you'll see options including:
     - API keys
     - Webhooks ← Click this!
     - Events
     - Logs
     - etc.

4. **Click "Webhooks"**
   - Click on **"Webhooks"** under Developers
   - You should now see the webhooks page

## Method 2: If You Don't See "Developers" Option

If the sidebar is collapsed or you're on mobile:

1. **Look for a Menu Icon**

   - Click the hamburger menu (☰) or menu icon in the top left
   - This will expand the sidebar
   - Look for "Developers"

2. **Search for "Webhooks"**

   - Use the search bar at the top of Stripe Dashboard
   - Type: "webhooks"
   - Click on the "Webhooks" result

3. **Check Your Account Type**
   - Make sure you're logged in with an account that has developer access
   - If you're part of a team, check if you have the right permissions

## Method 3: Alternative Routes

If you still can't find it, try these:

1. **Go to Settings First**

   - Click **"Settings"** in the left sidebar
   - Look for "Developers" or "Webhooks" in the settings menu

2. **Use the URL Structure**
   - The webhooks page is always at: `https://dashboard.stripe.com/[test/]webhooks`

## Once You're on the Webhooks Page

You should see:

1. **"Add endpoint"** button (top right) - Click this to create a webhook

## What to Do Next (After Finding Webhooks)

### Step 1: Create Webhook Endpoint

1. **Click "+ Add endpoint"** or **"Add endpoint"** button

2. **Enter Endpoint URL:**

   ```
   https://your-app-name.vercel.app/webhook/stripe
   ```

   ⚠️ **Note:** You'll need your Vercel URL first. If you haven't deployed yet, you can:

   - Create the webhook after deployment
   - OR use a placeholder URL for now and update it later

3. **Add Description (optional):**

   ```
   Production webhook for Syntheverse PoC
   ```

4. **Select Events:**
   Click **"Select events"** or **"Add events"** and check:

   - ✅ `checkout.session.completed`
   - ✅ `customer.subscription.created`
   - ✅ `customer.subscription.updated`
   - ✅ `customer.subscription.deleted`
   - ✅ `invoice.payment_succeeded`
   - ✅ `invoice.payment_failed`

5. **Click "Add endpoint"**

### Step 2: Get the Webhook Secret

1. Click on the webhook you just created
2. Scroll to **"Signing secret"** section
3. Click **"Reveal"** button
4. Copy the secret (starts with `whsec_`)

### Step 3: Add to Vercel

1. Go to Vercel → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` with the `whsec_...` value
3. Redeploy
