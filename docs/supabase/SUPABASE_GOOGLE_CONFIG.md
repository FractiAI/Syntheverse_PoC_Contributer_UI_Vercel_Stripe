# ✅ Google OAuth Configuration - Final Step

## What Supabase is Asking For:

### Client ID:

- **Where to get it:** Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services → Credentials → Your OAuth client
- **What it looks like:** Long string ending in '.googleusercontent.com'
- **Example:** 123456789-abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.apps.googleusercontent.com

### Client Secret:

- **Where to get it:** Same place as Client ID
- **What it looks like:** Shorter random string
- **Example:** GOCSPX-abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwx

## How to Enter:

1. **Client ID field:** Copy from Google Cloud Console and paste
2. **Client Secret field:** Copy from Google Cloud Console and paste
3. **Click 'Save' button**

## After Saving:

- You should see a success message
- Google OAuth is now enabled for your Supabase project

## Test It:

```bash
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000/signup
# Click 'Continue with Google'
# Should work!
```

## If You Get Errors:

- Double-check Client ID and Secret are copied correctly
- Make sure no extra spaces
- Verify the OAuth client in Google Cloud Console is for this project

## Security Note:

- These credentials are now securely stored in Supabase
- You can delete them from your clipboard/any temporary notes
- Never share or commit them anywhere else

Ready to paste your credentials and test OAuth!
