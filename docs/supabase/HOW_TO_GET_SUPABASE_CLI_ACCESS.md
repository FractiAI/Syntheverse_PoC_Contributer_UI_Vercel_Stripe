# How to Get Supabase CLI Access Token

## Method 1: Generate Access Token via Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**

   - Visit: https://app.supabase.io/
   - Sign in to your account

2. **Go to Account Settings**

   - Click on your profile/avatar (usually top right corner)
   - Click on "Account Settings" or "Preferences"
   - OR go directly to: https://app.supabase.io/account/tokens

3. **Create Access Token**

   - Look for "Access Tokens" section
   - Click "Generate New Token" or "Create Token"
   - Give it a name (e.g., "CLI Access Token")
   - Copy the token immediately (you won't be able to see it again!)

4. **Use the Token**
   - Once you have the token, provide it to me
   - I'll use it with: `supabase login --token YOUR_TOKEN`

## Method 2: Login via CLI (Interactive Browser Flow)

If you prefer, you can run this command and it will open your browser:

```bash
supabase login
```

This will:

1. Open your browser
2. Ask you to authorize the CLI
3. Automatically authenticate

However, since I need to use the CLI on your behalf, Method 1 (access token) is better.

## Method 3: Check Current Authentication

To see what's currently authenticated:

```bash
supabase projects list
```

---

## Once You Have the Token

1. Copy the access token from Supabase dashboard
2. Share it with me
3. I'll authenticate using: `supabase login --token YOUR_TOKEN`
4. Then I can access your project and check OAuth configuration

**Security Note:** The access token gives full access to your Supabase account. Only share it in a secure context (like this conversation), and you can revoke it later in the dashboard if needed.
