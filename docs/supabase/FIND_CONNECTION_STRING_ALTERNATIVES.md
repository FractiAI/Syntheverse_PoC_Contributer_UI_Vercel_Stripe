# 🔍 Alternative Ways to Find Database Connection String in Supabase

**If you don't see "Connection string" option, try these:**

---

## Option 1: Look for "Connection Pooling" or "Connection Info"

In the Database settings page, look for:

- **"Connection Pooling"** section
- **"Connection Info"** section
- **"Database Settings"** → might have a connection string
- **"Connection Parameters"**

---

## Option 2: Check Under "Project Settings" or "General"

1. Still in Settings (⚙️), try clicking **"General"** or **"Project Settings"**
2. Look for any database-related connection information there

---

## Option 3: Use the SQL Editor to Get Connection Info

1. In the left sidebar, click **"SQL Editor"**
2. Or look for **"Database"** → **"SQL Editor"**
3. Sometimes connection info is shown there

---

## Option 4: Look for "Database URL" or "Connection URL"

Some Supabase UIs show it as:

- **"Database URL"**
- **"Connection URL"**
- **"Postgres Connection"**

---

## Option 5: Use API Settings (Alternative Method)

1. Go to: **Settings** → **API**
2. Look for database-related connection information
3. Sometimes connection strings are shown alongside API keys

---

## Option 6: Check What Sections You DO See

**Can you tell me what sections/options you see on the Database settings page?**

Common sections might be:

- Connection Pooling
- Database Extensions
- Database Password (this is where you can reset password)
- Database Settings
- Connection Info
- Connection Parameters
- etc.

---

## Option 7: Build It Manually (If You Have Password)

If you can find the **database password** somewhere, we can build the connection string manually:

**Format:**

```
postgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@db.jfbgdxeumzqzigptbmvp.supabase.co:5432/postgres
```

**Where to find password:**

- Settings → Database → Look for "Database password" section
- Or "Reset database password" button
- After resetting, you'll see the password

---

## Option 8: Use Supabase CLI (If Installed)

If you have Supabase CLI installed, you can get connection info:

```bash
supabase db connection-string --project-ref jfbgdxeumzqzigptbmvp
```
