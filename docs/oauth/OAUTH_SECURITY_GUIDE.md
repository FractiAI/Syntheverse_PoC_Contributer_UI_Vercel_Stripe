# 🔐 OAuth Credentials Security Best Practices

## ❌ NEVER Share These Publicly:

- Client Secret (private key)
- Supabase Service Role Key
- Database passwords
- API keys with write permissions

## ✅ Safe Ways to Handle Credentials:

### Option 1: Configure Yourself (Recommended)

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Providers
2. Enable Google OAuth
3. Paste Client ID and Client Secret directly
4. Never save them anywhere else

### Option 2: Use Environment Variables Locally

Add to .env.local (never commit):

```
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
```

### Option 3: Temporary Sharing (Not Recommended)

- Use a secure, private communication method
- Delete immediately after use
- Never store in chat history

## 🛡️ Security Rules:

- Client ID is public (safe to share)
- Client Secret is private (never share)
- Always configure in Supabase dashboard directly
- Use environment variables for local development only

## What I Can Help With:

- Guide you through Supabase configuration steps
- Help troubleshoot any errors
- Provide exact copy-paste instructions
- But I cannot handle your actual credentials
