## OAuth Provider Redirect URLs

### Google Cloud Console

- Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
- Find your OAuth 2.0 Client ID
- Verify "Authorized redirect URIs" includes:
  - `https://syntheverse-poc.vercel.app/auth/callback`
  - `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback` (for local testing)

### GitHub OAuth App

- Go to: https://github.com/settings/developers
- Find your OAuth App
- Verify "Authorization callback URL" is set to:
  - `https://syntheverse-poc.vercel.app/auth/callback`
  - (or add multiple URLs if supported)

## Test OAuth Buttons

1. Go to: https://syntheverse-poc.vercel.app/signup
2. Click "Continue with Google" button
3. Click "Continue with GitHub" button
4. Both should redirect to the OAuth provider's login page

If buttons still don't work, check browser console for errors.
