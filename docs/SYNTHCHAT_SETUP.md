# SynthChat Setup - Storage Bucket RLS Policies

## Overview

The new WhatsApp-style SynthChat interface requires a Supabase storage bucket for image uploads.

## Required Setup

### Step 1: Create Storage Bucket (if not exists)

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → **Storage**
2. Click **New Bucket**
3. Create bucket with:
   - **Name:** `synthchat-images`
   - **Public bucket:** ✅ YES (toggle on)
   - Click **Create bucket**

### Step 2: Add RLS Policies

Go to **SQL Editor** and run this SQL:

```sql
-- Ensure bucket exists and is public
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types)
VALUES (
  'synthchat-images', 
  'synthchat-images', 
  true,
  5242880, -- 5MB limit for images
  ARRAY['image/jpeg', 'image/jpg', 'image/png', 'image/gif', 'image/webp']
)
ON CONFLICT (id) 
DO UPDATE SET 
  public = true,
  file_size_limit = 5242880,
  allowed_mime_types = ARRAY['image/jpeg', 'image/jpg', 'image/png', 'image/gif', 'image/webp'];

-- Remove any existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can upload chat images" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public read access for chat images" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own chat images" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own chat images" ON storage.objects;

-- Policy 1: Allow authenticated users to upload
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload chat images"
ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'synthchat-images'
);

-- Policy 2: Allow public read access
CREATE POLICY "Public read access for chat images"
ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (
  bucket_id = 'synthchat-images'
);

-- Policy 3: Allow users to update their own images
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own chat images"
ON storage.objects
FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'synthchat-images' AND
  auth.uid() = owner
)
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'synthchat-images' AND
  auth.uid() = owner
);

-- Policy 4: Allow users to delete their own images
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own chat images"
ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'synthchat-images' AND
  auth.uid() = owner
);
```

### Step 3: Verify

1. Go to **Storage** → **Policies**
2. Filter by `synthchat-images`
3. You should see 4 policies:
   - ✅ Authenticated users can upload chat images
   - ✅ Public read access for chat images
   - ✅ Users can update their own chat images
   - ✅ Users can delete their own chat images

## API Endpoints

All endpoints require authentication:

2. **GET /api/synthchat/rooms/[roomId]/messages**
   - Returns messages for room (500 most recent)

3. **POST /api/synthchat/upload-image**
   - Uploads image to storage
   - Returns public URL

4. **POST /api/synthchat/upload-file** (existing)

## Security

- ✅ Authentication required for all chat actions
- ✅ Must be room participant to view messages
- ✅ File size limits enforced (images 5MB, PDFs 10MB)
- ✅ File type validation (images only, PDFs only)
- ✅ Users can only modify/delete their own uploads
- ✅ Public read access for message display

## Troubleshooting

**Issue:** Image upload fails with 403 error

**Solution:** Run the SQL above to create RLS policies

---

**Issue:** Can't see messages in chat

**Solution:** Ensure you're a participant of the room (check chat_participants table)

---

**Issue:** Chat doesn't update

**Solution:** Messages poll every 3 seconds - wait or refresh page

## Next Steps

Once the SQL is run and bucket is set up:

1. ✅ Navigate to a chat room from SynthChatNavigator
2. ✅ Try sending a text message
3. ✅ Try uploading an image
4. ✅ Try uploading a PDF
5. ✅ Try searching messages
6. ✅ Verify on mobile devices
