# FractiAI Research Team - Complete Roster

**Last Updated:** January 2025  
**Status:** Active Development Team  
**Protocol:** Testing and Legal remain outside shell by protocol (preserving integrity)

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

The **FractiAI Research Team** is a multidisciplinary collective of experts spanning AI research, creative industries, design, education, and technology. The team operates under a protocol that maintains testing and legal functions outside the development shell to preserve system integrity.

**Team Architecture:** The team operates through specialized node types including **Multiplexers**, **Prisms**, **Specialists**, and **Specialist Generalists** (including General Contractors and Queen Bee Fractal Operator Geyser Nodes). See [`docs/TEAM_ARCHITECTURE_MULTIPLEXERS_PRISMS_SPECIALISTS.md`](TEAM_ARCHITECTURE_MULTIPLEXERS_PRISMS_SPECIALISTS.md) for complete architecture documentation.
