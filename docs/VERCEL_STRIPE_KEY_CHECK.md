# Vercel Stripe Key Check

## Status

✅ **STRIPE_SECRET_KEY exists** in Vercel environment variables for:

- Production environment
- Preview environment

## Issue Found

The Stripe API error "Invalid character in header content ["Authorization"]" suggests the Stripe secret key may contain invalid characters (whitespace, newlines, etc.).

## Fix Applied

Code changes have been made to sanitize the Stripe key:

- ✅ Added key sanitization in `utils/stripe/api.ts`
- ✅ Added key sanitization in `app/page.tsx`
- ✅ Added key sanitization in `app/webhook/stripe/route.ts`
- ✅ Added format validation (must start with `sk_test_` or `sk_live_`)

## Manual Verification Required

Since Vercel encrypts sensitive environment variables, you need to manually verify the key in the Vercel dashboard:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/fractiais-projects/syntheverse-poc/settings/environment-variables
2. Check the `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` for Production
3. Ensure it:
   - Starts with `sk_test_` or `sk_live_`
   - Has NO spaces, newlines, or special characters at the beginning/end
   - Is exactly as shown in your Stripe Dashboard

## How to Fix (if needed)

1. Copy the key from Stripe Dashboard (exactly as shown)
2. In Vercel, edit the `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` variable
3. Delete the existing value
4. Paste the key (make sure no extra spaces/characters)
5. Save

## Next Steps

After the sanitization code is deployed, the Stripe initialization should work correctly even if there are minor whitespace issues in the key.
