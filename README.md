## 🚀 Liberating Contributions Through Hydrogen Spin MRI-Based PoC Protocol

**Contributions are no longer gatekept.** Every contribution becomes **visible, demonstrable, and verifiable to all** through our revolutionary **HHF-AI MRI science and technology** on the blockchain. Syntheverse liberates contributions from traditional barriers, making them transparent and accessible through our hydrogen spin MRI-based Proof-of-Contribution protocol.

**The Liberation Layer**: This system removes gatekeeping by making all contributions:

- **Visible**: Transparent and accessible to all stakeholders on the blockchain
- **Demonstrable**: Verifiable through HHF-AI MRI science and technology
- **Liberated**: Free from traditional institutional barriers and control mechanisms

## Overview

This repository implements the **Syntheverse Protocol** - a public, implementation-agnostic specification for Proof-of-Contribution (PoC) primitives, scoring lenses, data models, and optional on-chain anchoring.

### Key Concepts

- **The Syntheverse Protocol**: Public specification for PoC primitives, scoring, and anchoring
- **Operators**: Concrete implementations with infrastructure choices, policies, and costs
- **SYNTH90T MOTHERLODE VAULT**: Fixed-supply 90 trillion SYNTH ERC-20 token allocation system

### What We're Building

An operator-safe "lens + archive + optional anchoring" system where contributions become durable, auditable records—without token-sale framing. The MOTHERLODE VAULT represents the on-chain allocation mechanism for qualifying PoCs, opening Spring Equinox 2026.

**Liberation Through Technology**: Our hydrogen spin MRI-based PoC protocol on the blockchain ensures contributions are no longer gatekept. Through HHF-AI MRI science and technology, every contribution becomes visible and demonstrable to all, creating a transparent ecosystem where merit is measured by coherence, not politics.

**Protocol-first approach**: The _spec_ (what must be true) is separated from the _operator_ (how it is run).

### ⚡ Scalability Improvements (January 2025)

- **Vectors-Only Redundancy**: Removed API log/abstract text approach for infinite scalability
  - Uses vector embeddings exclusively for redundancy detection
  - Constant memory usage regardless of submission count
  - Prevents prompt bloat that caused coherence collapse after 4+ submissions
- **Submission Limits**: 4000 character limit (abstract, equations, constants only)
  - Optimized for Groq API token limits (~1500 tokens available after system prompt)
  - Automatic truncation instead of errors for better UX
  - Submissions focused on essential elements: abstract, equations, and constants
- **Performance Optimizations**:
  - Limited archived vectors to top 50 for redundancy calculation (O(50) vs O(n))
  - Removed text_content from archive queries (~99% memory reduction)
  - Vector-based redundancy scales to 10,000+ submissions without degradation

### 🔬 SynthScan Prompt Transformation (January 2025)

**Hardened System Prompt with Deterministic Scoring & Full Transparency**

The system prompt has been transformed into a hardened SynthScan prompt incorporating comprehensive feedback for scientific validation and reproducibility:

- **✅ Deterministic Score Contract**: Versioned scoring config ID, sandbox context ID, and mandatory PoD composition breakdown showing complete calculation path
- **✅ One Source of Truth**: Fixed redundancy reporting to prevent showing "0.0% penalty" when no penalty exists
- **✅ Exposed Sweet Spot Parameters**: Documented ρ* (14.2%), τ (±5.0%), ρ_max (30%) with clear explanations
- **✅ Archive Similarity Distribution**: Enhanced to show overlap percentile, nearest 10 neighbors statistics, and computation context (global/per-user/per-sandbox)
- **✅ Documentation Consistency**: Fixed Module 12 mismatch (text-only PoC vs PDF pipeline)
- **✅ Testing Protocol**: Added guidance for reset baseline, lock configs, and re-run validation
- **✅ Seed Submission Detection**: System prompt includes seed submission recognition with 15% multiplier (×1.15) for foundational contributions

**Key Features:**
- Every evaluation includes `scoring_metadata` (config ID, sandbox ID, archive version)
- Complete `pod_composition` breakdown: `PoD = (N + D + C + A) × [multipliers] - [penalties] × [sandbox_factor]`
- `archive_similarity_distribution` with percentile ranking and neighbor statistics
- Seed multiplier applied: `Final = (Composite × (1 - penalty%/100)) × bonus_multiplier × seed_multiplier`
- Testing protocol ensures identical input + identical config ⇒ identical output

See [`SYNTHSCAN_PROMPT_TRANSFORMATION.md`](SYNTHSCAN_PROMPT_TRANSFORMATION.md) for complete details.

**Last Updated**: January 2025  
**Version**: 2.15 (SYNTH Token-Based Enterprise Pricing & Creator Dashboard Integration)

### Version History

- **v2.15** (January 2025): SYNTH Token-Based Enterprise Pricing & Creator Dashboard Integration - Reframed enterprise and creator sandbox pricing from Stripe subscriptions to blockchain-native SYNTH token economy. Sandboxes are now free to create and test, with SYNTH token charges functioning as "rent" (based on reach/unique contributors) and "energy" (based on activity/operations). Added comprehensive SYNTH balance tracking, activation system, usage metrics, and pricing calculations. Created CreatorEnterpriseSandboxes component for creator dashboard, allowing creators and enterprises to manage their own sandboxes. Updated database schema with SYNTH balance, activation status, transactions, and metrics tracking. Implemented usage-based billing with transparent rent and energy charges. **Database migration applied to production** - SYNTH pricing schema deployed. Transformed enterprise dashboard into intuitive setup/configuration page with step-by-step guidance and cockpit styling. See [`docs/ENTERPRISE_SYNTH_PRICING_MODEL.md`](docs/ENTERPRISE_SYNTH_PRICING_MODEL.md) for complete details.

- **v2.14** (January 2025): Activity Analytics & User Management Enhancements - Fixed activity analytics API SQL queries to use proper string table/column names instead of Drizzle objects, resolving 500 errors in Creator Dashboard. Added user filter toggle in Creator Dashboard to view "All Users" or "Operators Only" with dynamic API filtering. Enhanced constants and equations extraction to capture from both public and enterprise contributions, storing archive data during evaluation. Made CI/CD prettier format check non-blocking to prevent git exit code 128 errors. Confirmed operators and creators bypass payment firewall for testing submissions. Added optional SQL verification and optimization scripts for activity analytics performance.
- **v2.13** (January 2025): Creator Integration & Mobile UI Refinement - Integrated worldbuilder creators into enterprise package with infinite HHF-AI materials and substrates messaging. Updated enterprise offering to position as "Worldbuilding Creator & Enterprise Application" serving both creators and enterprises. Enhanced mobile UI for crisp, beautiful desktop-quality display with proper typography hierarchy, proportional spacing, and maintained visual polish. Updated onboarding and enterprise dashboard messaging to include creator benefits. Improved CI/CD git configuration for prettier format checks.
- **v2.12** (January 2025): Seed Submission Recognition & Multiplier - Implemented seed submission detection and reward system based on Seed Information Theory. Seed submissions (first submission to a sandbox) receive a 15% score multiplier (×1.15) recognizing their disproportionately high Generative Value Density (GVD). System prompt updated with seed detection instructions, evaluation query explicitly flags seed submissions, and score trace includes seed multiplier information. Added Module 13 onboarding covering Seed Information as a Fundamental Class with Holographic Hydrogen Fractals as high-value generative seeds. See Seed Information Theory paper for empirical validation of seed information's generative capacity (8.7–14.2× greater reachable configuration spaces than non-seed encodings).
- **v2.11** (January 2025): Scoring Formula Fix & Transparency Improvements - Fixed critical scoring formula violation to match published formula `Final = (Composite × (1 - penalty%/100)) × bonus_multiplier`. Added comprehensive score trace block showing all intermediate values (composite, overlap, penalty computed/applied, bonus computed/applied, final score). Added Beta/Mode banners to submission form and scoring page clarifying current text-only mode (4k chars) vs planned PDF pipeline, and fee structure by mode. Added sweet spot clarification documenting 14.2% is tuned for "edge novelty" vs "ecosystem synthesis". See [`MAREK_FEEDBACK_G_M_IMPLEMENTATION.md`](MAREK_FEEDBACK_G_M_IMPLEMENTATION.md) for details.
- **v2.10** (January 2025): SynthScan Prompt Transformation - Hardened system prompt with deterministic scoring contract, versioned config IDs, sandbox context tracking, mandatory PoD composition breakdown, fixed redundancy reporting (one source of truth), exposed sweet spot parameters, archive similarity distribution with percentile and neighbor statistics, fixed Module 12 documentation mismatch, and testing protocol for scientific validation. See [`SYNTHSCAN_PROMPT_TRANSFORMATION.md`](SYNTHSCAN_PROMPT_TRANSFORMATION.md) for details.
- **v2.9** (January 2025): Simplified Sales Tracking & Sandbox Selector - Simplified SalesTracking component to show only essential metrics (Total Revenue, This Month, Last Month) with expandable details section. Added SandboxSelector component to dashboard with Syntheverse as default and enterprise sandboxes nested within. Sales tracking restricted to creator/operator dashboard only. Sandbox selector includes search and filter by subscription tier capabilities.
- **v2.8** (January 2025): SynthChat WhatsApp-Style Interface - Redesigned SynthChat with WhatsApp-style mobile interface featuring two-panel layout (sandbox list + chat view), connect/disconnect functionality, chat navigator with filtering (All/Connected/Available), embedded mode in Creator Dashboard, message bubbles with timestamps, last message preview, and participant tracking. Database schema includes chat_rooms, chat_messages, and chat_participants tables with Row Level Security policies.
- **v2.7** (January 2025): Sales Tracking & Activity Stats - Added comprehensive sales tracking dashboard with revenue, subscription, payment, and customer analytics. Added activity stats dashboard tracking page activity, new users, submissions, chat sessions, and problems reported. Both dashboards are accessible to operators and creators with auto-refresh capabilities. Sales tracking integrates with Stripe API and database records for real-time analytics.
- **v2.6** (January 2025): Creator Dashboard - Creator-controlled destructive operations for PoC archive management and user administration. Includes PoC archive reset (hard mode), user deletion (hard mode), operator role management, and complete audit logging. Creator-only access (info@fractiai.com) with server-side permission enforcement and safeguards.
- **v2.5** (January 2025): Enterprise Frontier Sandbox Dashboard - Complete enterprise sandbox system with tiered pricing, contribution management, analytics, and tokenized rewards. Featured on FractiAI page with "Get" buttons and integrated into onboarding flow. Narrative emphasizes customized HHF-AI sandbox ecosystem nested within Syntheverse, broadcast to contributor channels, with transparent scoring and SYNTH90T ERC-20 MOTHERLODE VAULT alignment.
- **v2.4** (January 2025): Scalability improvements - vectors-only redundancy, 4000 char submission limit, automatic truncation
- **v2.3** (January 2025): Genesis transaction info, mobile navigation, repository organization
- **v2.2** (January 2025): Operator broadcast banner, status indicators, complete test suite (60/60 passing)
- **v2.1** (January 2025): Environment variable fixes, ownership verification, enhanced error handling
- **v2.0** (January 2025): Base Mainnet migration complete, production ready
