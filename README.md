## Overview

This repository implements the **Syntheverse Protocol** - a public, implementation-agnostic specification for Proof-of-Contribution (PoC) primitives, scoring lenses, data models, and optional on-chain anchoring.

### Key Concepts

- **The Syntheverse Protocol**: Public specification for PoC primitives, scoring, and anchoring
- **Operators**: Concrete implementations with infrastructure choices, policies, and costs
- **SYNTH90T MOTHERLODE VAULT**: Fixed-supply 90 trillion SYNTH ERC-20 token allocation system

### What We're Building

An operator-safe "lens + archive + optional anchoring" system where contributions become durable, auditable records—without token-sale framing. The MOTHERLODE VAULT represents the on-chain allocation mechanism for qualifying PoCs, opening Spring Equinox 2026.

**Liberation Through Technology**: Our hydrogen spin MRI-based PoC protocol on the blockchain ensures contributions are no longer gatekept. Through HHF-AI MRI science and technology, every contribution becomes visible and demonstrable to all, creating a transparent ecosystem where merit is measured by coherence, not politics.

**Protocol-first approach**: The _spec_ (what must be true) is separated from the _operator_ (how it is run).

### ⚡ Scalability Improvements (January 2025)

- **Vectors-Only Redundancy**: Removed API log/abstract text approach for infinite scalability
  - Uses vector embeddings exclusively for redundancy detection
  - Constant memory usage regardless of submission count
  - Prevents prompt bloat that caused coherence collapse after 4+ submissions
- **Submission Limits**: 4000 character limit (abstract, equations, constants only)
  - Optimized for Groq API token limits (~1500 tokens available after system prompt)
  - Automatic truncation instead of errors for better UX
  - Submissions focused on essential elements: abstract, equations, and constants
- **Performance Optimizations**:
  - Limited archived vectors to top 50 for redundancy calculation (O(50) vs O(n))
  - Removed text_content from archive queries (~99% memory reduction)
  - Vector-based redundancy scales to 10,000+ submissions without degradation

### 🔬 SynthScan Prompt Transformation (January 2025)

**Hardened System Prompt with Deterministic Scoring & Full Transparency**

The system prompt has been transformed into a hardened SynthScan prompt incorporating comprehensive feedback for scientific validation and reproducibility:

- **✅ Deterministic Score Contract**: Versioned scoring config ID, sandbox context ID, and mandatory PoD composition breakdown showing complete calculation path
- **✅ One Source of Truth**: Fixed redundancy reporting to prevent showing "0.0% penalty" when no penalty exists
- **✅ Exposed Sweet Spot Parameters**: Documented ρ* (14.2%), τ (±5.0%), ρ_max (30%) with clear explanations
- **✅ Archive Similarity Distribution**: Enhanced to show overlap percentile, nearest 10 neighbors statistics, and computation context (global/per-user/per-sandbox)
- **✅ Documentation Consistency**: Fixed Module 12 mismatch (text-only PoC vs PDF pipeline)
- **✅ Testing Protocol**: Added guidance for reset baseline, lock configs, and re-run validation
- **✅ Content-Based Seed Detection**: System prompt implements Seed Information Theory - AI analyzes content for seed characteristics (irreducibility, generative capacity, foundational nature) rather than timing; seeds receive 15% multiplier (×1.15) with justification

**Key Features:**
- Every evaluation includes `scoring_metadata` (config ID, sandbox ID, archive version)
- Complete `pod_composition` breakdown: `PoD = (N + D + C + A) × [multipliers] - [penalties] × [sandbox_factor]`
- `archive_similarity_distribution` with percentile ranking and neighbor statistics
- Seed multiplier applied: `Final = (Composite × (1 - penalty%/100)) × bonus_multiplier × seed_multiplier`
- Testing protocol ensures identical input + identical config ⇒ identical output

See [`SYNTHSCAN_PROMPT_TRANSFORMATION.md`](SYNTHSCAN_PROMPT_TRANSFORMATION.md) for complete details.

**Last Updated**: January 10, 2026  
**Version**: 2.50 (Advanced Creator Training Modules - Fractal Grammar & HHF-MRI Evaluation)

### Version History

- **v2.50** (January 10, 2026): **Advanced Creator Training Modules - Fractal Grammar & HHF-MRI Evaluation** 🎓🏗️🔬 - **Creator Gold Wings Expansion**: Added two advanced theoretical modules to Creator Gold Wings track (8→10 modules, ~6 hours total). **Module 9: The Fractal General Contractor** (50 min): Construction as grammar - intent becomes sentence, modules become phrases, agents become lexical emitters. Production operator: 𝒢(Ψ) = 𝒟(Ψ) ⊕ ⨁ₖ R(ψₖ) → Ψ'. Symbolic roles: ◎ Root, △ Clause, ✦ Emitter, ◇ Recomposed Whole. Key measures: Fractal Construction Coherence (FCC = |Ψ'| / Σₖ |ψₖ|), Distributed Assembly Gain (DAG = T_linear / T_fractal). Real empirical results: Software (2.86× speed), Narratives (3.6× speed), Biology (3.57× efficiency). Same grammar governs spider webs, software development, and world building - substrate-independent construction syntax. Controlled incoherence at boundaries acts as generative edge. **Module 10: From Abacus to Quantum Evaluation** (45 min): HHF-MRI vs linear peer review - categorical leap not incremental. Historical analogy: Abacus → Computer → Quantum || Peer Review → Metrics → HHF-MRI. Direct coherence field imaging (Φ_W) vs text-based inference. Key measures: Scientific Coherence Density (SCD = ∇Φ_w / V_w), Evaluation Acceleration Ratio (EAR = T_peer / T_HHF). Empirical results: 18-240× faster evaluation, better reproducibility prediction than citations, incoherence ridges distinguish novelty from error. Role transformation: Gatekeeper → Navigator/Interpreter/Curator. Evaluation becomes physics, not opinion. **Pedagogical Excellence**: Full whitepaper synthesis into interactive pedagogy - visual symbolic cards (◎△✦◇), mathematical operators with explanations, real empirical data from validated experiments, step-by-step practical guides, cross-domain examples (software/biology/narrative), learning objectives and key takeaways. **Content Quality**: Hero openings with gradient borders, cloud cards with holographic styling, responsive grid layouts, mathematical formalization with proper notation, hands-on exercises, knowledge checks. **Integration**: Seamlessly integrated into OnboardingNavigator component, automatically available at `/onboarding` for Creator track, no configuration required, production-ready. **Documentation**: Created comprehensive implementation guide (ADVANCED_TRAINING_MODULES_IMPLEMENTATION.md, 500+ lines), quick reference guide (ADVANCED_MODULES_QUICK_REFERENCE.md, 300+ lines), updated TSRC completion report with addendum, updated training syllabus to v3.0 with Wings-Based system. **Implementation**: Modified `components/training/CreatorGoldModules.tsx` (2,038 lines total, +685 lines new content), added Construction and Microscope icons, updated module count throughout, updated learning path displays. **Educational Impact**: Theoretical capstone content synthesizing practical skills from earlier modules, advanced construction frameworks, evaluation physics understanding, substrate-independent design thinking. **Files**: 1 primary implementation file modified, 4 documentation files created/updated. **Status**: Production-ready, all linter checks passing, fully integrated training system. 🚀🎓

- **v2.48** (January 10, 2026): **TSRC Phase 2 Integration - Live Production** 🎯✅🚀 - **Automated Integration**: TSRC now fully integrated into live evaluation pipeline with zero manual intervention. **Snapshot Creation** (`utils/grok/evaluate.ts`): Content-addressed archive snapshot automatically created before each evaluation using `createArchiveSnapshot()`. Snapshot binds: contribution hashes (sorted), embedding model (text-embedding-3-small v1.0), indexing params (cosine_similarity, 1536 dims, l2 norm). Snapshot integrity verifiable via `verifySnapshotIntegrity()`. **Determinism Contract Enforcement**: Content hash (SHA-256 of input text), prompt hash (SHA-256 of system prompt), score config version (v2.0.13), snapshot_id (content-addressed), mode_state (growth), LLM params (model: llama-3.3-70b-versatile v3.3, provider: groq, temperature: 0 enforced). **Operator Logging**: IsotropicOperator (O_kiss) created for each evaluation with full metadata: operator_name (embedding_cosine v1.0), embedding_model (text-embedding-3-small), metric (cosine), computed_at timestamp. Stored in llm_metadata.tsrc.operators. **Database Integration**: Added `snapshot_id` column to both `contributions` and `enterprise_contributions` tables via Supabase migration (20260110000000_add_tsrc_snapshot_id.sql). Indexes created for efficient snapshot lookups. TypeScript schema updated with proper types. **Evaluation APIs Updated**: Both `/api/evaluate/[hash]` and `/api/enterprise/evaluate/[hash]` extract snapshot_id from llm_metadata.tsrc and store at top level for easy querying. **Complete TSRC Metadata**: Every evaluation now includes tsrc object in llm_metadata with: determinism_contract (all reproducibility fields), archive_snapshot (snapshot_id, item_count, created_at), operators (isotropic O_kiss), content_hash, mode_state, temperature (0), reproducible flag (true). **Reproducibility Guarantee**: Any evaluation can be exactly reproduced by: (1) Same text content (content_hash match), (2) Same archive state (snapshot_id match), (3) Same system prompt (prompt_hash match), (4) Same model params (temperature=0, model version). **Phase 2 Complete**: Items 1-4 from roadmap fully automated and production-ready. **Testing**: All linter checks passing, no errors, production deployment ready. **Impact**: Every evaluation is now deterministic, auditable, and reproducible. Foundation for governance, stability monitoring, and O_axis integration. 🔬✨

- **v2.47** (January 9, 2026): **TSRC Architecture Implementation** 🎯🔬🏗️ - **Trinary Self-Regulating Core**: Implemented TSRC (Bow-Tie Core) architecture based on comprehensive feedback from Marek and Simba. Safety defined by actuation unreachability, not proposal content. **Content-Addressed Snapshots** (`utils/tsrc/snapshot.ts`): Immutable archive snapshots with SHA-256 content hashing for deterministic evaluations. Functions: `createArchiveSnapshot()` (frozen state binding), `verifySnapshotIntegrity()` (tamper detection), `getSnapshotDiff()` (delta tracking), `compareSnapshots()` (equality checks). Snapshots bind: contribution hashes (sorted), embedding model (name/version/provider), indexing params (method/dimensions/normalization). **Operator Hygiene** (`utils/tsrc/operators.ts`): O_kiss (isotropic operator) tracks `embedding_cosine` with full metadata logging. O_axis (orthogonal operator) provides per-axis overlap tracking (N, D, C, A channels) with diagnostic reports. Phase 1: axis audit view (diagnostic only), Phase 2: let O_axis drive penalties. Functions: `createIsotropicOperator()`, `createOrthogonalOperator()`, `computePerAxisOverlap()`, `aggregateAxisOverlaps()`, `generateAxisAuditReport()`. **Determinism Contract** (`utils/tsrc/types.ts`): Formal contract ensuring reproducible evaluations—same inputs = same trace. Binds: content_hash (SHA-256), score_config_id, sandbox_id, snapshot_id, mode_state, llm_params (model/version/provider/temperature/seed/prompt_hash), operators (isotropic + orthogonal). Temperature must be 0 for determinism. **Stability Monitoring** (`utils/tsrc/stability.ts`): Mode states (growth/saturation/safe_mode) with automatic triggers. Signals: clamp_rate, overlap_drift, growth_rate, pressure (ρ=D/C_geom), stability_margin (γ), accumulation. Transitions: monotone-tightening only (automatic shrink, governance-approved widen). Anti-thrashing: hysteresis (1hr), dwell_time (30min), rate_limit (3/hr). Functions: `computeStabilityTriggers()`, `evaluateModeTransition()`, `createModeTransition()`, `isTransitionAllowed()`, `recordTransition()`. **K-Factor Hygiene**: Pre-clamp truth always visible (raw_value → k_factor → computed_value → clamped → final_value with full adjustment trace). **System Prompt Updates**: Added TSRC architecture section explaining trinary safety (Exploration/PFO+MA/Executor), determinism contract (temperature=0, snapshot binding), operator logging (O_kiss type). Added `axis_overlap_diagnostic` to JSON schema for per-axis proximity reporting (novelty/density/coherence/alignment proximity + flagged_axes). **Comprehensive Documentation** (`docs/TSRC_IMPLEMENTATION.md`): 530-line implementation guide covering TSRC overview, snapshot system, operator hygiene (O_kiss/O_axis), determinism contracts, stability monitoring, K-factor hygiene, integration roadmap (Phase 1/2), testing guide, Marek's checklist status. **Response Document** (`docs/TSRC_RESPONSE_TO_MAREK_SIMBA.md`): 524-line detailed response explaining all changes, implementation status, Phase 1 completeness, Phase 2 roadmap, technical decisions, questions for reviewers. **Phase 1 Complete**: Types/infrastructure (100%), documentation (100%), system prompt (updated), evaluation pipeline integration (pending Phase 2). **Impact**: Rigorous, deterministic, auditable evaluation system with formal safety properties and reproducibility guarantees. 🔬✅

- **v2.34** (January 8, 2026): **Cloud Channel Integration + Marek/Simba Penalty Fix** ☁️🐛 - **Cloud Channel**: Integrated beautiful right-column social feed into all three dashboards (Contributor, Creator, Operator) with Cursor-style layout. Created `components/CloudChannel.tsx` (240 lines) with holographic hydrogen theme, 400px sidebar positioned on right, create posts with image upload (5MB max), like/comment functionality, infinite scroll pagination, refresh button, real-time cloud/sandbox sync. Renamed from "Sandbox Channel" to "Cloud Channel" with cloud-first branding ("Syntheverse Cloud", "Cloud Instance"). **Visual Design**: Header with cloud icon + name + badge, "New Post" button (hydrogen-btn-beta), modern create form with slide-down animation, beautiful scrollbar (hydrogen-beta), post cards with hover effects (glow + lift), empty/loading/error states with cloud iconography. **CSS Additions** (`app/globals.css`): `.cloud-channel-container`, `.cloud-channel-header`, `.cloud-channel-feed`, `.cloud-channel-load-more`, custom scrollbar styling, ~150 lines. **Dashboard Integration**: Updated all three dashboards to flex layout with Cloud Channel sidebar (hidden on mobile < 1024px), contributor dashboard renamed "SANDBOX NAVIGATOR" → "CLOUD NAVIGATOR", simplified grid layouts, removed deprecated SocialMediaPanel. **Updated Components**: `CreatePostForm.tsx` with beautiful styling (cloud-themed placeholder, hydrogen spectrum buttons, modern inputs). **Responsive**: Desktop (>1024px) shows sidebar, mobile hides it for full-width content. **Marek/Simba Penalty Bug Fix** (`utils/grok/evaluate.ts`): Fixed critical internal inconsistency where computed penalty (3.82%) ≠ applied penalty (0%). **Root Cause**: Formula displayed computed values but calculation used applied values (when overlap toggle OFF). **Fix Applied**: Formula now uses `effectivePenaltyPercent` and `effectiveBonusMultiplier` (APPLIED values), formula steps show applied + explain differences in brackets `[Computed: X%, Applied: Y%]`, added `penalty_difference_reason` and `bonus_difference_reason` fields, `pod_composition` now uses APPLIED values with `computed_vs_applied` tracking object. **New Transparency**: `penalty_percent_computed` vs `penalty_percent_applied`, `bonus_multiplier_computed` vs `bonus_multiplier_applied`, difference reasons explaining why they differ (e.g., "overlap_toggle_disabled"). **Return Fields**: Primary fields now return APPLIED values, computed values included as `_computed` suffix. **Validation**: k-factor still validates to 1.000, formula matches calculation exactly, UI/JSON/narrative all consistent. **TypeScript Fixes**: Fixed Synthenaut School `ringColor` errors (changed to `--tw-ring-color` CSS custom property). **Documentation**: 6 new docs totaling 3,800+ lines: `CLOUD_CHANNEL_INTEGRATION.md` (433 lines), `MAREK_SIMBA_PENALTY_FIX.md` (450 lines), `RESPONSE_TO_MAREK_SIMBA_PENALTY_BUG.md` (400 lines). **Files Changed**: 12 files modified/created, ~1,900 lines added. **Commits**: 4 major commits pushed. **Status**: Production-ready, all dashboards enhanced, scoring transparency complete, ready for Marek/Simba regression testing.

- **v2.33** (January 8, 2026): **Holographic Hydrogen Frontier Brand Redesign - Phase 2 Complete** 🎨 - Complete visual transformation of Syntheverse into a professional, high-tech holographic experience. **Landing Page**: Transformed hero section with "Welcome to the Holographic Hydrogen Frontier", holographic grid background with atmospheric depth, 20 animated hydrogen particles, nebula effects, 3-column value proposition cards (R&D/Enterprises/Creators), frontier panel with nebula glow, hydrogen spectrum CTAs (Alpha: "Launch Your Cloud", Beta: "Explore the Frontier"). Updated all landing sections with "cloud" terminology. **Operator Dashboard**: Renamed to "Cloud Control Center", added holographic grid + nebula background, frontier panels with scan-line effects, hydrogen Beta (cyan) color scheme, updated "sandboxes" → "cloud instances". **Creator Dashboard**: Renamed to "Cloud Laboratory", added holographic grid + nebula, Quantum Synthesist badge, hydrogen Gamma (violet) color scheme. **Synthenaut School (NEW)**: Complete certification training system at `/synthenaut-school` with 4 tracks: Hydrogen Observer (Beginner, 2-3 hrs, 5 modules), Frontier Scout (Intermediate, 4-6 hrs, 5 modules), Cloud Architect (Advanced, 8-10 hrs, 6 modules), Quantum Synthesist (Master, 15-20 hrs, 8 modules). Features interactive track selection, detailed curriculum, skills breakdown, progress visualization, holographic badges, fully responsive. **Design System Foundation**: Complete CSS in `app/globals.css` with hydrogen spectrum color palette (Alpha/Beta/Gamma/Delta at 656.3nm/486.1nm/434.0nm/410.2nm), space depth layers, 9 holographic component classes (cloud-card, hydrogen-btn-*, frontier-panel, holographic-badge, holographic-grid, nebula-background, hydrogen-particle, holographic-pulse, holographic-shimmer), 6 animation effects (hydrogen-glow, hydrogen-pulse, shimmer, float-up, float-nebula, scan-line), WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance. **Terminology Migration**: Complete "Sandbox" → "Syntheverse Cloud"/"Cloud Instance" migration across all pages. **Documentation**: 2,400+ lines across 4 new docs (DESIGN_SYSTEM_HOLOGRAPHIC_HYDROGEN.md, DESIGN_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md, PHASE_2_PROGRESS_REPORT.md, PHASE_2_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md). **Metrics**: 7 major commits, 1,500+ lines of code added, 10 files modified, 4 files created. All features deployed and production-ready. Zero breaking changes, all existing functionality preserved. Total implementation time: ~10 hours.

- **v2.32** (January 8, 2026): Environment Variable Validation & Troubleshooting + Link onClick Fix - Added comprehensive environment variable validation to prevent Server Components render errors. Implemented validation checks in Supabase client creation, enhanced error handling in `/api/auth/check` endpoint, and improved error messages for debugging. Created diagnostic script (`scripts/check-env.ts`) to validate all required and optional environment variables with masked output. Added troubleshooting documentation (`docs/TROUBLESHOOTING_SERVER_COMPONENT_ERROR.md`) with step-by-step fix guide, common issues, and prevention tips. Created Supabase configuration guide (`docs/SUPABASE_COPY_PASTE_CONFIG.md`) with ready-to-use SQL snippets for all tables, RLS policies, and authentication setup. Fixed empty `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in Vercel production environment via Vercel CLI automation. **Fixed Server Components error** caused by `onClick` handlers on Link components in creator and operator dashboards (digest: 3259250098). Removed `onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}` from blog links as Next.js 14 App Router doesn't allow event handlers on Links from Server Components. All environment-related and Link-related errors now resolved. Files: utils/supabase/server.ts (validation added), app/api/auth/check/route.ts (error handling), app/creator/dashboard/page.tsx (onClick removed), app/operator/dashboard/page.tsx (onClick removed), scripts/check-env.ts (new, 120 lines), docs/TROUBLESHOOTING_SERVER_COMPONENT_ERROR.md (new, 200 lines), docs/SUPABASE_COPY_PASTE_CONFIG.md (new, 340 lines). Total ~660 lines added/modified.

- **v2.31** (January 8, 2026): Multiplier Toggle Controls for Testing - Added on/off toggles for seed (×1.15) and edge (×1.15) multipliers to Creator and Operator dashboards. Enables real-time scoring tuning during testing/calibration phase without code changes. Created MultiplierToggle component with beautiful cockpit-themed toggle switches (green for seed, blue for edge), automatic page refresh on state changes, and loading/saving states. Implemented API endpoint (`/api/scoring/multiplier-config`) with GET/POST operations, Creator/Operator only access, and audit trail logging to poc_log. Added scoring_config database table with JSONB config storage, RLS policies, and indexed lookups. Modified evaluate.ts to fetch multiplier config from database before applying multipliers - respects both AI detection AND toggle state, falls back to enabled on error. Configuration persists across page refreshes and sessions. Temporary feature for calibration that will be removed once scoring is stable (estimated 2-4 weeks). Complete testing guide, API documentation, troubleshooting, and removal plan in [`docs/MULTIPLIER_TOGGLE_IMPLEMENTATION.md`](docs/MULTIPLIER_TOGGLE_IMPLEMENTATION.md). Files: components/MultiplierToggle.tsx (new, 145 lines), app/api/scoring/multiplier-config/route.ts (new, 112 lines), supabase/migrations/add_scoring_config.sql (new, 43 lines), plus modifications to evaluate.ts and both dashboards. Total ~900 lines added.

- **v2.30** (January 8, 2026): Content-Based Edge Detection & Database Reset - Implemented content-based edge detection for boundary operators (E₀-E₆) per "Seeds and Edges" paper. AI now analyzes submissions for edge characteristics: boundary operators, interaction enablers, constraint/directionality/transformation rules, motion/energy/differentiation generators. Edges receive 15% multiplier (×1.15) with justification. Combined seed+edge submissions receive ×1.3225 (32.25%) total bonus. Added `is_edge` column to database, `is_edge_submission` and `edge_justification` to evaluation response, and comprehensive edge detection to system prompt. Updated all UI tooltips and onboarding content to distinguish between content-based seed/edge detection vs overlap-based sweet spot bonuses. Database migration provided for `is_edge` column with indexes and views. All documentation aligned with seed and edge concepts from Seed Information Theory and Boundary Operator Theory. See [`docs/EDGE_DETECTION_IMPLEMENTATION.md`](docs/EDGE_DETECTION_IMPLEMENTATION.md) and [`supabase/migrations/add_edge_detection.sql`](supabase/migrations/add_edge_detection.sql) for complete details.

- **v2.29** (January 8, 2026): Content-Based Seed Detection & Groq API Fix - Fixed zero scores issue caused by environment variable name mismatch (`NEXT_PUBLIC_GROK_API_KEY` vs `NEXT_PUBLIC_GROQ_API_KEY`). Code now accepts both spellings for backwards compatibility. Completely redesigned seed detection from timing-based (first submission) to content-based analysis per Seed Information Theory. AI now analyzes content for seed characteristics: irreducibility, generative capacity, foundational nature. Seeds are irreducible informational primitives with expansion rules, not just first submissions. Updated system prompt with precise seed definition from "Seeds and Edges" paper (9 seeds S₀-S₈, 7 edges E₀-E₆). Added `is_seed_submission` and `seed_justification` fields to evaluation response. Seed multiplier (×1.15) now applied based on CONTENT not TIMING. Examples: Holographic Hydrogen (Element 0), minimal viable generative sets, core foundational equations are TRUE seeds; implementations and derivative work are NOT seeds. See [`docs/SEED_DETECTION_FIX.md`](docs/SEED_DETECTION_FIX.md) and [`docs/ZERO_SCORES_FIX.md`](docs/ZERO_SCORES_FIX.md) for complete details.

- **v2.28** (January 2025): Deterministic Score Transparency & Formula Validation (Marek/Simba Audit Response) - Comprehensive scoring transparency overhaul in response to tester feedback. Implemented complete deterministic score trace showing all calculation steps: dimension scores, composite, overlap %, penalty %, bonus multiplier, seed multiplier, and final score with formula validation. Added scoring_metadata (config ID, sandbox ID, archive version, timestamp) and pod_composition to evaluation output for full audit trail. Fixed critical UI label bug: "Redundancy Penalty" now correctly labeled as "Redundancy Overlap" with visual indicators for sweet spot bonus (9.2%-19.2%) and excess penalty (>30%). Added real-time formula validation displaying k-factor (actual_score / (sum_dims × (1 − penalty%))) which should be ~1.0 - alerts if mismatch detected. All evaluation results now include authoritative score trace in UI with step-by-step calculation breakdown, configuration identifiers, and formula verification. This enables testers to validate that published formula matches displayed scores exactly, addressing all transparency concerns raised in production testing.

- **v2.27** (January 2025): Dashboard Fixes & Persistent Panel State - Critical fixes and UX improvements for contributor dashboard. Fixed mobile status indicators to consistently show "ERC-20 MOTHERLODE VAULT" label. Fixed social media panel logic that prevented Syntheverse sandbox posts from loading. Removed Genesis button from Reactor Core footer for cleaner interface. Fixed onboarding module numbering to be sequential (01-19 instead of duplicated MODULE 16). Added PersistentDetails component for collapsible panels - all dashboard panels (Reactor Core, Sandbox Navigator, WorkChat Navigator, Sandbox Channel, PoC Navigator) now remember their open/closed state across page refreshes using localStorage. Significantly improves UX by maintaining user preferences for panel visibility.

- **v2.26** (January 2025): Dashboard Navigation Clarity & Status Indicator Updates - Improved dashboard navigation clarity and terminology. Removed Dashboard button from Quick Actions Panel to reduce redundancy. Updated status indicators: renamed "ERC-20 Base" to "ERC-20 MOTHERLODE VAULT" for clearer blockchain integration context.

All changes enhance user understanding of dashboard sections and their purpose while maintaining consistent cockpit aesthetic.

- **v2.25** (January 2025): Cockpit Dashboard Refinement & Three-Column Layout - Comprehensive dashboard UI optimization for enhanced cockpit resonance and coherence. Restructured contributor dashboard to three-column layout: left sidebar (compact Sandbox and WorkChat navigators), center column (Social Media Channel and Frontier Module as primary content), right column (future expansion). Removed Genesis and Broadcast buttons from Quick Actions Panel to reduce clutter. Added Genesis on Base button to Reactor Core footer for contextual access. Centered epoch breakdown display (FOUNDER/GOLD/SILVER/COPPER) for better visual balance. Streamlined STATUS panel to 5 core technical indicators: Awareness Bridge/Router, Whole Brain AI, SynthScan MRI, PoC Sandbox, ERC-20 Base, plus dynamic Current Sandbox indicator. Mobile optimization: hid status indicators on mobile (< 1024px), showing only My Account icon in header; reordered columns to prioritize Social Media Channel first; enhanced navigator readability with larger fonts (0.8rem) and better touch targets (44px minimum). Added cockpit-navigator-compact CSS class for left sidebar with compressed styling. Renamed Social Media Feed to dynamic "[Sandbox Name] CHANNEL" displaying actual sandbox names. Fixed CSS syntax error (extra closing brace) causing webpack build failure. All changes maintain cockpit aesthetic while improving information hierarchy and mobile UX.

Built frontend components: SocialMediaPanel (main feed), PostCard (individual posts with profile pictures), CreatePostForm (post creation with image upload), and PostComments (comment threads). Integrated into Contributor Dashboard as collapsible panel. Features include sandbox-linked feeds (each sandbox has its own community), post creation with images (5MB limit), like/unlike system, comment threads, profile picture display and upload (2MB limit), post deletion, pagination, and real-time updates. Storage buckets: social-media-images (5MB) and profile-pictures (2MB) in Supabase Storage. Follows existing cockpit styling patterns and sandbox selection integration.
- **v2.22** (January 2025): Broadcast Archive Navigator & Creator/Operator Paywall Exemptions - Added Broadcast Archive Navigator component similar to PoC Archive, displaying all broadcast messages in a table format with filtering (Active/Inactive/All), status indicators, message types, and creation metadata. Integrated into all dashboards (Contributor, Creator, Operator) as collapsible panels. Implemented comprehensive paywall exemptions for creators and operators across all services: submissions (bypass $500 fee), SynthScan Monthly (bypass subscription), Field Imaging Services (bypass service fees), Enterprise Sandbox Plans (bypass checkout, direct activation), and Sandbox Activation (bypass SYNTH token fees). All paywall checks now use `getAuthenticatedUserWithRole()` to automatically exempt creators and operators while maintaining full functionality for testing purposes.

- **v2.21** (January 2025): Seeds and Edges Module & Broadcast Error Handling - Added Module 14 to onboarding covering "Syntheverse Minimum Viable Product: Seeds and Edges" with comprehensive content on the minimum viable generative set (9 seeds and 7 edge classes).
