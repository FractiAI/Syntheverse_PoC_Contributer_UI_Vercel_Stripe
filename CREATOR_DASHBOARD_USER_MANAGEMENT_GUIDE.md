# Creator Dashboard - User Management Location Guide

## 🔍 Where to Find User Management

The **User Management** (User Navigator) is located inside a **tabbed interface** in the Creator Dashboard.

### Navigation Path:

1. **Go to Creator Dashboard** (`/creator/dashboard`)

2. **Scroll to "Configuration Controls" Section**
   - Look for the panel with a ⚙️ Settings icon
   - Title: "Configuration Controls"
   - Description: "System configuration and administrative controls"

3. **Click to Expand** (if collapsed)
   - Click on the section header to expand it

4. **Select the "Operators" Tab**
   - Inside the Configuration Controls panel, you'll see tabs:
     - **PoC Archive** (default)
     - **Operators** ← Click here!
     - **On-Chain Proofs**
     - **Database**
     - **Chat**
     - **Blog**

5. **User Management Interface**
   - Once you click "Operators", you'll see:
     - Filter: "All Users" or "Operators Only"
     - Search bar
     - List of users with:
       - **Grant Operator** button (for non-operators)
       - **Revoke Operator** button (for operators)
       - **Delete User** button

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If you don't see the Configuration Controls section:

1. **Clear browser cache**:
   - Chrome/Safari: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
   - Or: DevTools → Network tab → Disable cache → Hard refresh

2. **Check Vercel deployment**:
   - Go to https://vercel.com/your-project/deployments
   - Verify latest commit (`b195c7a` or later) is deployed
   - Status should be "Ready" (green checkmark)

3. **Check browser console**:
   - Press F12 → Console tab
   - Look for any red errors
   - Common issues:
     - Import errors
     - Component render errors
     - Network request failures

### If the "Operators" tab is missing:

1. **Check if you're logged in as Creator**
   - Email should be: `info@fractiai.com`
   - Role should be: `creator`

2. **Verify component is rendering**:
   - Open DevTools → Elements tab
   - Search for: `CreatorCockpitNavigation`
   - Check if the tabs are present in the DOM

## ✅ Recent Fixes (v2.55 & v2.56)

- **v2.55**: Fixed "Grant Operator" button hanging (30s timeout)
- **v2.56**: Fixed "Delete User" button hanging (30s timeout)

Both buttons now show:
- Loading spinner during processing
- "Granting..." / "Revoking..." / "Deleting..." text
- Timeout error alerts after 30 seconds
- Better error messages

## 📝 Notes

- The User Management interface was **NOT removed** - it's just inside a tabbed interface
- Default tab is "PoC Archive", so you need to click "Operators" to see user management
- This is intentional design to organize multiple admin functions in one panel
