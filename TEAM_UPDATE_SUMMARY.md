## 🔒 Protocol Compliance

**Key Principle:** Testing and Legal remain outside shell by protocol to preserve system integrity.

**Separation:**
- **Inside Shell:** Core development team operates within development environment
- **Outside Shell:** Testing and Legal provide independent validation and oversight

**Benefits:**
- Independent validation
- Protocol-preserved integrity
- Clear separation of concerns
- Governance oversight
