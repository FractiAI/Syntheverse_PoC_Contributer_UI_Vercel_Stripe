# Marek & Simba Score Transparency Validation Guide

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive validation guide for the scoring transparency improvements implemented in response to Marek and Simba's audit feedback.

---

## Issues Addressed ✅

### 1. **Published Formula Mismatch** ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: The formula `k = actual_score / (sum_dims × (1 − penalty%))` was varying widely instead of being ~1.0

**Fix**: 
- Added complete deterministic score trace to every evaluation
- All calculation steps now visible: composite → penalty → bonus → seed → final
- Real-time k-factor validation in UI alerts if mismatch detected

**How to Validate**:
1. Submit a PoC or view existing evaluation results
2. Scroll to "📊 Deterministic Score Trace" section
3. Check "Formula Validation" subsection
4. Verify k-factor is ~1.0 (within rounding tolerance)
5. If mismatch, UI shows ⚠️ alert with Marek callout

### 2. **UI Label Bug: "Redundancy Penalty" Actually Showing Overlap %** ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Label said "Redundancy Penalty: 43.3%" but was actually overlap %, not penalty %

**Fix**:
- All labels changed: "Redundancy Penalty" → "Redundancy Overlap"
- Separate display for actual penalty: "Excess-Overlap Penalty: X%" (only shown if >0)
- Visual indicators added:
  - ⚡ Sweet Spot (9.2%-19.2% overlap) - green
  - ⚠ Penalty Applied (>30% overlap) - orange

**How to Validate**:
1. Submit a PoC or view existing evaluation
2. Check "Redundancy Analysis" section
3. Verify label reads "Redundancy Overlap: X%"
4. If overlap in sweet spot (9.2%-19.2%), see "⚡ Sweet Spot Bonus"
5. If overlap >30%, see "⚠ Excess Penalty Applied"
6. Actual penalty % now in separate "Excess-Overlap Penalty" field

### 3. **Non-Authoritative Narrative/JSON** ✅ ADDRESSED

**Problem**: Grok narrative output contained wrong math, impossible timestamps, contradictory status

**Fix**:
- Added AUTHORITATIVE `score_trace` object calculated by TypeScript code, not AI
- Score trace is computed from actual evaluation steps, not Grok's narrative
- UI displays authoritative trace prominently with "📊 Deterministic Score Trace"
- Grok narrative still shown but subordinate to authoritative trace

**How to Validate**:
1. View any evaluation result
2. Look for "📊 Deterministic Score Trace" section (blue background)
3. This is the authoritative calculation - computed by TypeScript
4. Compare to Grok narrative (if shown) - trace is source of truth
5. All database records now include `score_trace`, `scoring_metadata`, `pod_composition`

### 4. **Missing Traceability: Hidden Multipliers/Factors** ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Additional internal factors not surfaced (sandbox composite, regime selector, seed multiplier, etc.)

**Fix**:
- Complete score trace shows ALL applied factors:
  - Composite calculation (N+D+C+A)
  - Overlap % measured
  - Penalty % computed and applied
  - Bonus multiplier computed and applied
  - Seed multiplier (if applicable)
  - Sandbox factor (currently 1.0, but extensible)
- Configuration identifiers added:
  - `score_config_id`: "v2.0.13(overlap_penalty_start=30%, sweet_spot=14.2%±5%, weights:N=1.0/D=1.0/C=1.0/A=1.0)"
  - `sandbox_id`: Actual sandbox identifier or "pru-default"
  - `archive_version`: Archive snapshot version
  - `evaluation_timestamp`: ISO 8601 timestamp

**How to Validate**:
1. View evaluation result with score trace
2. Check "Configuration" section shows:
   - Config ID with all parameters
   - Sandbox ID
   - Archive version
   - Timestamp
3. Verify all 8 calculation steps displayed:
   1. Composite (sum of dimensions)
   2. Overlap %
   3. Penalty % (if >30%)
   4. After Penalty
   5. Bonus Multiplier (sweet spot)
   6. After Bonus
   7. Seed Multiplier (if seed submission)
   8. Final Score (clamped 0-10,000)
4. Formula string shows complete calculation
5. No hidden factors - everything is visible

## New Data Structures

### Score Trace Object
```typescript
score_trace: {
  dimension_scores: {
    novelty: number;      // 0-2500
    density: number;      // 0-2500
    coherence: number;    // 0-2500
    alignment: number;    // 0-2500
  };
  composite: number;      // Sum of dimensions
  base_pod_score: number; // Before multipliers
  overlap_percent: number; // Measured overlap %
  penalty_percent_computed: number;  // Calculated penalty
  penalty_percent_applied: number;   // Actually applied
  bonus_multiplier_computed: number; // Calculated bonus
  bonus_multiplier_applied: number;  // Actually applied
  seed_multiplier?: number;          // 1.15 if seed, else 1.0
  is_seed_submission?: boolean;
  after_penalty: number;             // Step-by-step calculation

  formula: string;                   // Human-readable formula
  clamped: boolean;                  // Whether score hit limits
}
```

### Scoring Metadata Object
```typescript
scoring_metadata: {
  score_config_id: string;      // Version + parameters
  sandbox_id: string;           // Sandbox identifier

    density: number;
    coherence: number;
    alignment: number;
    composite: number;
  };

## Testing Protocol

### Pre-Deployment Checklist

1. **Verify Database Schema**
   ```sql
   -- Check that score_trace, scoring_metadata, pod_composition are stored
   SELECT 
     submission_hash,
     metadata->'score_trace' as score_trace,
     metadata->'scoring_metadata' as scoring_metadata,
     metadata->'pod_composition' as pod_composition
   FROM contributions
   WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

2. **UI Display Verification**
   - Submit test PoC
   - Verify all 3 label fixes:
     - "Redundancy Overlap" (not "Redundancy Penalty")
     - "Excess-Overlap Penalty" shown separately
     - Sweet spot/penalty indicators visible
   - Verify score trace section displays
   - Verify k-factor calculation shown
   - Verify configuration identifiers shown

3. **Formula Validation Test**
   - Take any score trace
   - Manually calculate: `composite × (1 - penalty%/100) × bonus × seed`
   - Compare to `final_score` in trace
   - Should match within ±1 (rounding tolerance)
   - k-factor = `final_score / (composite × (1 - penalty%/100))`
   - Should be = `bonus × seed` (typically 1.0 to 1.15)

### Post-Deployment Validation

1. **Same PoCs, Full Trace Comparison**
   - Re-evaluate same PoCs from audit
   - Compare old scores to new scores
   - Verify k-factor now stable ~1.0
   - Verify all calculation steps visible
   - Verify configuration locked and displayed

2. **Regression Testing**
   - Verify existing qualified PoCs remain qualified
   - Verify metal assignments unchanged
   - Verify redundancy analysis still generated
   - Verify founder certificates still issued

3. **Edge Case Testing**
   - **Seed Submission**: Verify 1.15 multiplier shown
   - **Sweet Spot Overlap (9.2-19.2%)**: Verify bonus applied
   - **Excess Overlap (>30%)**: Verify penalty shown separately
   - **Minimal Overlap (<9.2%)**: Verify neutral (no bonus/penalty)

## Expected Outcomes

### ✅ Transparency Goals Met

1. **Identical input + identical config ⇒ identical output**: YES
   - Config locked in `scoring_metadata`
   - All parameters visible
   - No hidden factors

2. **Published formula matches displayed scores**: YES
   - k-factor validation in UI
   - Step-by-step calculation shown
   - Alerts if mismatch detected

3. **Redundancy reporting clear**: YES
   - Overlap % vs Penalty % separate
   - Sweet spot bonus clearly indicated
   - Excess penalty only shown if applied

4. **Narrative subordinate to trace**: YES
   - Authoritative TypeScript calculation
   - Score trace computed from actual steps
   - Not dependent on Grok's math

### ✅ Marek's Minimal Changes Request

1. **Deterministic score trace**: ✅ Added to every evaluation
2. **Config identifiers**: ✅ score_config_id, sandbox_id, archive_version, timestamp
3. **Label fix**: ✅ "Redundancy Penalty" → "Redundancy Overlap"
4. **Narrative handling**: ✅ Trace is authoritative, narrative is commentary

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current Implementation
- Sandbox factor is hardcoded to 1.0 (extensible for future sandbox-level adjustments)
- Grok narrative still may contain math errors - trace is authoritative
- Archive version is timestamp-based (can be enhanced with snapshot IDs)

### Planned Enhancements
- Lock archive snapshot per evaluation for reproducibility
- Add cluster penalty/boost to trace (if implemented)
- Add metal/epoch factor to trace (if implemented)
- Enhance pod_composition with regime selector visibility
