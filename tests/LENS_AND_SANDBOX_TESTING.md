## Key Testing Principles

### 1. **Consistency**

- ✅ Same input → same output (deterministic)
- ✅ Similar inputs → similar scores (within variance threshold)
- ✅ Score ordering reflects quality differences

### 2. **Justifiability**

- ✅ All scores include justifications
- ✅ LLM metadata captured for full provenance
- ✅ Redundancy analysis explains overlap decisions
- ✅ Metal justification explains alignment
- ✅ **Calibration against peer-reviewed papers validates scoring accuracy**

### 3. **Sandbox Accuracy**

- ✅ Embeddings generated correctly
- ✅ 3D coordinates mapped using HHF geometry
- ✅ Vector similarity calculated accurately
- ✅ Redundancy detected via geometric distance

### 4. **Edge Cases**

- ✅ Sweet-spot overlap (10-20%) → bonus multiplier
- ✅ Excessive overlap (>30%) → penalty
- ✅ No overlap → neutral (no penalty/bonus)
- ✅ Boundary conditions handled gracefully
